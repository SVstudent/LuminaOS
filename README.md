## Overview

LuminaOS is a premium, AI-native education platform that fundamentally reimagines how students learn and how teachers teach. It replaces static LMS tools with a **living, intelligent system** where every interaction is powered by Google's Gemini 3 AI — from voice-native Socratic tutoring to real-time teacher analytics.

Unlike traditional education software, LuminaOS treats AI as a **first-class participant** in the learning process, not an afterthought. Students speak naturally with an AI tutor that listens, draws diagrams, and finds resources. Teachers get instant visibility into every AI-student interaction without lifting a finger.

## Features

### 🎙️ Lumina Sync — Voice-Native AI Tutoring

The flagship feature. Students open a **real-time voice session** with Lumina, an AI Socratic tutor powered by **Gemini 3 Native Audio**.

- **Natural Voice Dialogue**: Gemini 3's native audio model enables real conversational tutoring — no text-to-speech, no robotic responses. The AI thinks and responds directly in voice.
- **Neural Soundwave Visualizer**: A 5-bar animated soundwave pulses in real-time with the student's and AI's voice, providing an immersive, focus-driven interface.
- **AI-Powered Whiteboard**: During voice sessions, Lumina can generate educational diagrams, graphs, and illustrations directly onto a live canvas using **Gemini 3 Image Generation**.
- **Socratic Method**: Lumina doesn't give answers — it asks probing questions, guides reasoning, and helps students discover concepts themselves.
- **Session Summary & Resources**: After each session, Gemini 3 compiles topics covered and discovers real educational resources (Khan Academy, YouTube, Wikipedia) via **Google Search Grounding**.
- **Full Persistence**: Every voice session — transcript, topics, resources, engagement score — is automatically saved to **Firebase Firestore** for teacher review.

### 💬 Lumina Chat — Text-Based AI Tutoring

For quick questions or quieter environments, students can chat with Lumina via text.

- **Streaming AI Responses**: Powered by **Gemini 3 Flash**, responses stream in real-time for a natural conversational feel.
- **Incremental Session Persistence**: Chat sessions are saved to Firestore incrementally — every message is captured, not just the final state.
- **Topic Synthesis**: After a few exchanges, Gemini 3 automatically identifies the main topic being discussed and updates the session metadata for teacher analytics.
- **Context-Aware**: Lumina knows the student's classroom, assignments, and teacher context, providing personalized tutoring.

### 👨‍🏫 Teacher Assistant — AI-Powered Teaching Tools

Teachers get their own AI assistant for content creation and classroom management.

- **Assignment Generation**: Describe what you need, and Gemini 3 drafts complete assignments with rubrics.
- **Announcement Drafting**: Generate professional classroom announcements in seconds.
- **Quiz Creation**: Auto-generate quiz questions based on topics and difficulty level.
- **Class Performance Analysis**: AI analyzes student data and provides actionable insights.

### 📊 AI Learning Analytics Hub

Real-time teacher dashboard showing every student's AI interactions.

- **Lumina Session Feed**: Every voice and chat session appears instantly via Firestore `onSnapshot` real-time listeners.
- **Engagement Scoring**: Each session gets an AI-calculated engagement score (1-10) based on interaction depth.
- **Topic Tracking**: See exactly what topics students are exploring with AI assistance.
- **AI Grading Insights**: When students use "Analyze My Progress," the AI grading results are persisted and displayed in real-time.

### 🎓 Student Dashboard

- **Classroom Overview**: See all enrolled classrooms with instructor info and upcoming assignments.
- **Assignment Management**: View, submit, and track assignments with AI-powered progress analysis.
- **Vision Lab**: Upload images for AI-powered visual analysis and educational insights using Gemini 3's multimodal capabilities.

### 🔐 Authentication & Security

- **Firebase Auth**: Secure authentication with email/password and **Google Sign-In** (one-click OAuth).
- **Role-Based Access**: Distinct Student and Teacher experiences with appropriate permissions.
- **Demo Mode**: Built-in demo credentials on the login page for instant access during evaluations.

## Google Integration Deep Dive

LuminaOS leverages **six Google products** to deliver a seamless AI-native experience:

### Gemini 3 Native Audio
The voice tutoring system (Lumina Sync) uses Gemini 3's native audio model — the AI processes speech and generates voice responses directly, without intermediate text-to-speech. This produces natural, conversational dialogue that feels like talking to a real tutor.

### Gemini 3 Flash
Every text-based AI interaction — chat responses, grading analysis, topic synthesis, teacher assistant tools — runs through Gemini 3 Flash for fast, intelligent processing.

### Gemini 3 Image Generation
During voice tutoring sessions, when a student asks about a visual concept (e.g., "graph y = x²"), the system uses Gemini 3's image generation to create educational diagrams that render directly on the whiteboard canvas.

### Google Search Grounding
After each tutoring session ends, the system uses Google Search grounding (built into Gemini 3's tool-use capabilities) to find real, verified educational resources — Khan Academy videos, Wikipedia articles, official documentation — related to the topics discussed.

### Firebase Firestore
All application data — user profiles, classrooms, assignments, AI sessions, grading insights — is stored in Firestore. Real-time `onSnapshot` listeners ensure teachers see student activity the moment it happens, with no manual refresh needed.

### Firebase Auth
One-click Google Sign-In plus traditional email/password authentication. Role-based access control separates student and teacher experiences.
